My name’s Minh. I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in August 2022 with an Engineer’s degree—which is a fancy way of saying I survived late nights, too much coffee, and endless debugging. I’m fascinated by large distributed systems (the kind of tech puzzles that keep you awake at night, in a good way). I’m still a fresher, but I make up for it with curiosity and a habit of picking up new skills like side quests. In the short run, my goal is simple: evolve into a senior software engineer 👨‍💻 — the version of me that ships fewer bugs and maybe actually sleeps.
