My name is Minh. I've just graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) with Engineer's degree this August 2022.
I find building large distributed systems super fascinating. Though I'm still a fresher at the moment, I always try to keep an open mindset to learn new skills. My short-term goal is to become a senior software engineer 👨‍💻.
